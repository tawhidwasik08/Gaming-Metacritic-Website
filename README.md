# Gaming-Metacritic-Website
***Implemented using : php, html, css, MySQL, jQuery AJAX***<br>
It's an academic project I've worked on back in the varsity days (3.1). <br>
The idea was to create a simple gaming review website for users along with reviews from other big websites. 
Reviews can be liked/disliked, searching/sorting of games, login/logout and simple things like youtube trailers integration in the site was also done.
